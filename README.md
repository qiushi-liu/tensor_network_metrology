# Tensor network algorithm for optimizing control-enhanced quantum metrology
This repository contains the Python code and data accompanying the article "Efficient tensor networks for control-enhanced quantum metrology"([arXiv:2403.09519](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09519)). We implement the tensor network algorithm to efficiently maximize the quantum Fisher information (QFI) obtained by several types of strategies. Our approach covers a general and practical scenario where the experimenter applies $Nâˆ’1$ interleaved control operations between $N$ queries of the channel to estimate and uses no or bounded ancilla. 
## Requirements
The code for tensor contraction requires the Python package [opt_einsum](https://optimized-einsum.readthedocs.io/en/stable/). The code for SDP requires the Python package [CVXPY](https://www.cvxpy.org) with the optimizer [MOSEK](https://www.mosek.com). The code for variational circuit optimization requires the Python package [PennyLane](https://pennylane.ai/).
